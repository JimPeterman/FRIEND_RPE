# Reference Standards for Rating of Perceived Exertion During Exercise Testing: Data from the Fitness Registry and the Importance of Exercise International Database (FRIEND)

## Summary:
Rating of perceived exertion (RPE) is collected during exercise testing to monitor a subject's status. Peak RPE can also be used to indicate whether a subject performed a maximal effort during a cardiopulmonary exercise test (VO<sub>2max</sub> test). However, no study to date has reported the distribution of peak RPE values across a diverse cohort of individuals. **The purpose of this study was to create reference standards for peak RPE in healthy individuals performing a maximal exercise test.**
